Streamers utilizing programs such as [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) can add a Window Capture overlay that can target a color range for a "green screen" effect.

## Usage

Users can add new goals at the bottom of the form. Deleting or Editing goals is done by clicking on the text.

Goals don't save or persist however, so once the user leaves the window everything will reset.

## Tools used
Smash Goals primarily utilizes the React library. CSS and design emulated wonderfully by [@sdvim](https://github.com/sdvim)!
